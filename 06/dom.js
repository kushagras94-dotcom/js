/*
-> DOM[All Document elements are objects in javascript] 
    -> window is a global object which contains document object
    -> console.dir(document) gives the document object as it is
    -> document.baseURI - give the base url
    -> document.getElementById() - used to select the element with id

    -> targeting the elements [elements ko catch karna]
    -> document.getElementByClassName() //returns HTML collection

    -> element.className - gives the class name [used in react]
    -> element.id = gives the id
    -> element.getAttribute('att_name')
    -> element.setAttribute('att_name','att_value') - overwrites the pre-existing attribute
    -> element.style.color = 'red'

    -> element.textContent =  gives the display:none element too
    -> element.innerText = does not give the display:none elements
    -> element.innerHTML = gives the html too

    -> element.querySelector('any') = it can take any selector like we give in css
    -> We can also use querySelector or any selecting method on any element which contains some child nodes
    -> We can use forEach on NodeList which comes from querySelectorAll()
    -> NODELIST AND HTML COLLECTION are not pure arrays but nodelist has forEach() method
    -> Html collection do not have forEach() so it needs to be converted to array first
    -> Both nodelist & htmlcollection can be converted into array by using Array.from(nodeList/HtmlCollection)*/
